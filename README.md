StandardScaler standardizes a feature by subtracting the mean and then scaling to unit variance. Unit variance means dividing all the values by the standard deviation.
StandardScaler results in a distribution with a standard deviation equal to 1. The variance is equal to 1 also, because variance = standard deviation squared. And 1 squared = 1.
StandardScaler makes the mean of the distribution 0. About 68% of the values will lie be between -1 and 1
